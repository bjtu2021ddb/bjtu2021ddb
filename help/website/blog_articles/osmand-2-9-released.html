<div class="date">Jan. 28, 2018</div>
<p>OsmAnd 2.9 is here! Here are some of the most important updates.</p>
<h3>New context menu</h3>
<p>From now on, you can easily view all the essential information about a point of interest. Opening hours are shown in a more intuitive format, for example: 'Open till 7:00'. Also, you'll be able to check all details (phone number of a facility, opening hours, website, etc.) by pressing the 'Description' button. Press the 'Actions' button to get directions from that point, mark it as your parking position, etc. Also, in the same menu, you'll notice a 'Search near here' button. Press it and select the type of POI you're looking for. Very convenient if you're planning your trip ahead, for example, you need to view the banks that are close to your hotel.</p>

<p><b>Transport routes in context menu</b></p>
<p>If you press on a transport stop, you'll see the information about the transport routes available at this particular stop. Color-coded icons at the top of the menu provide a list of routes, and if you scroll down, you'll see a fuller info about each of them.</p>
<p>Press that color-coded icon to view the entire route on the map. You'll see that each stop on the route is marked with a transport icon. Press on such icon to view all info about that stop. You can easily 'move' along the route using the 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons. This way, you'll plan your trip efficiently.</p>
