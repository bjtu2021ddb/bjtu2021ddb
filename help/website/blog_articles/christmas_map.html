<p>Remember, you can add POI to the map without leaving the app! Just to Plugins menu to activate the 'OSM editing' plugin, then return to the map, make a long press on a certain point and select 'Create POI'. Then you'll have to switch to the Advanced tab, enter the name of the POI and select its type (for example, Christmas tree) below the 'Name' line. After that, you'll be able to add any tags using the button 'Add tag'. For instance, you can write the tag 'xmas:feature' and in the 'value' field write 'tree'. This way, the people searching for Christmas trees nearby will see this one, as well.</p>
