<h2>Join OsmAnd team on Youtube!</h2>
<p>Yes, we're developing a fully functional <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88mwfoC2RySqIOEvxJIv0A">Youtube channel</a> to provide you with the most interesting information about OsmAnd, mapping and using the power of OSM in your daily life.</p>
<p>You may remember that we've <a href="/blog/osmand_videos">started the channel</a> a while ago, but back than it was mainly a collection of the videos from other users. Now, we are starting the creation of our own content to give the most fresh and accurate information first-hand. We'll be making tutorials on some basic features and uncovering some not-so-obvious ways to use the app.  You'll see the features before their official release and will be able to discuss them with the team direcly in the comments.</p>
