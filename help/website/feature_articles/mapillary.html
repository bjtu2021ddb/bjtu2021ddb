<p>The Mapillary layer brings street-level views straight into the OsmAnd app. This means you can easily check out the surroundings at any place of interest or along the route you have planned with OsmAnd. Where imagery is missing, you can just add it yourself so that others can make use of it. This feature has emerged from our collaboration with the Mapillary team uniting the benefits of both apps.</p>

<div class="subtitle" id="How_to_start"><h2>How to enable it (for Android)</h2></div>

<p>To view the data provided by Mapillary contributors, you will have to enable the corresponding layer on the map. Please open the 'Configure map' menu and enable the 'Mapillary' option. After you return to the map, you'll see the layer of data.</p>

<div class="subtitle" id="Viewing_images"><h2>Viewing images</h2></div>
<p>The Mapillary feature is all about viewing the street-level imagery in the OsmAnd app. To do that, just enable the layer as described above, then zoom in till you see green dots along the streets and press any of them to view the related image. You can navigate along the imagery using the white arrows. The big ones at the bottom let you move to any image thatâ€™s spatially close, and the small ones at the top enable you to view and play the sequence of images that the same contributor recorded at the same time. That way you can 'take a ride' along the street.</p>

<div class="subtitle" id="Filtering_data"><h2>Filtering the data</h2></div>
<p>Besides viewing all Mapillary data, you can filter it to find what you need. You can filter the images by user and by time period. For example, you can view your own contributions made last week. To apply a filter, please go to the 'Configure map' menu and press on the 'Mapillary' option. You'll see the options menu. In the 'Filter' submenu, you can enter a Mapillary username and select the time period. Then press 'Apply'. Please note that you can only filter Mapillary points on 500 m zoom level or closer. If the data is represented as green lines without visible separate points, that means you are at a higher zoom and won't be able to filter the points.</p>

<div class="subtitle" id="Adding_images"><h2>Adding images</h2></div>
<p>Let's say you noticed a street without Mapillary coverage and decided to add images yourself. You can do that in two ways. You can conveniently use the Mapillary with the widget in the upper right corner of the map screen. If the widget is missing, please enable it in the 'Configure screen' menu. To add images, just press it and you'll be redirected to the Mapillary application (you have to install it separately, for example, from Google Play).</p>

</div>
<p>Also, you can open the context menu of a certain location, scroll to the end of the images at that location, and select 'Add photos'.</p>
<p>Using the filters, you can see which streets are densely-mapped and which are not. You can also check whether the data is fresh or not. After that, you can choose to avoid certain roads and take the ones you'd like to add images to instead. To do it, please build a route, then go to the context menu of the route, press the 'Settings' button and choose 'Avoid roads'.

<div class="subtitle" id="How_to_start_iOS"><h2>How to enable it (for iOS)</h2></div>

<p>You can view the street-level imagery in your location or anywhere in the world using the Mapillary in OsmAnd for iOS.</p>

<img src="/images/blog/ios-2-72/4.jpg"/>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div>

<p>Using the widget on the map, you'll be able to view images or videos and even add your own. To view the images and videos, you'll have to go to 'Configure screen' menu and enable the 'Mapillary' layer.</p>

</div>

 <p>Now you have access to an extensive database created by volunteers. To view media attached to a certain point on the map, just make a long tap there and open the context menu. You'll be able to scroll through images of the location easily.</p>
<p>Zoom in closer to view the images even more conveniently in a Mapillary window over your map. You can also press the white arrows to 'move' along the streets. To contribute to Mapillary, just press on the widget and take a picture.</p>
