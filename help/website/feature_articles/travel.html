<p>We always strived to make OsmAnd not just your navigator, but your all-around travel guide. That's why, in version 3.0, the 'Travel guides' option has been added.</p>

<p>Enjoy offline guides for basically any destination. The guides are based on <a href="https://www.wikivoyage.org/">Wikivoyage</a>, a community project similar to <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, where volunteer writers create articles with real and up-to-date information. Such information includes the main facts about a place, transport, landmarks, shopping spots, etc. Going to <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/London">London</a>, <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Shanghai">Shanghai</a> or planning a visit to <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Grand_Canyon">the Grand Canyon</a>? Your guide is there to help you.</p>



<p>To start using the feature, please go to <i>OsmAnd menu-> Travel guides</i>. Make sure to download the travel guide file to be able to use the feature. This file is also available in <i>Download map-> 'Travel guides' menu</i>.

<p>As soon as the file is downloaded, you can start using the guides. Just go to <i>OsmAnd-> 'Travel guides'</i> and enter the name of the city into the search field. As soon as you open the article, you'll see the information conveniently arranged by topic. The information often includes topics like <i>'Understand'</i> with the details about local culture and habits, <i>'Talk'</i>, <i>'Get in'</i>, <i>'Get Around'</i>, <i>'See'</i> that covers main places of interest, <i>'Buy'</i> with the recommended shopping spots, <i>'Sleep'</i>, <i>'Drink'</i>, and <i>'Go next'</i> suggesting the locations you may be interested in after visiting the current one.

<p>Custom Travel - creating your one-of-a-kind travel guide</p>
<p>Custom Travel tool helps you create your own travel guide and use it via OsmAnd Travel feature. Basically, you can use the text from any source (from Wikipedia to your friend's blog) and pair it with a GPX track.</p>
<div class="centeredimageblog">
    <img src="/images/blog/custom travel/customtravel_1.png"/>
    <img src="/images/blog/custom travel/customtravel_2.png"/>
    <div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div>
<h3>Prepare the files</h3>
<p>To start, please prepare your files. Save your track with '.GPX' extension and the text file as '.html'. In order to create your custom database successfully, the names of the GPX file and the html have to be identical. For example, 'Milan.gpx' and 'Milan.html'.</p>
<p>The GPX tracks can be downloaded from the internet or you can create one (using OsmAnd or any online GPX creation tool).</p>
<p>For example, you can use <!-- <a href="https://ridewithgps.com">RideWithGps</a> service,  --><a href="http://brouter.de/brouter-web">Brouter</a>, or a simialr one. </p>
<p>Add the points you'd like to visit into your route and then save that route as a GPX track. <!-- After that, upload it to your phone and open using OsmAnd. You can also view other people's routes or check  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/traces">OpenStreetMap GPX tracks</a>-->.</p>
<p>Preparing your GPX track in OsmAnd is also possible, you can read about it here: <a href="https://osmand.net/features/plan-route">Plan a route</a>.</p>
<p>Choosing the source for your guide's text is completely up to you. It can be  <a href="http://www.touropia.com/tourist-attractions-in-milan/">an article</a> in a travel blog, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan">Wikipedia page</a>, etc. Simply copy the text, then paste it into a text editor and save it with an 'HTML' extension. Make sure to make the name of the GPX track and the HTML file identical.</p>
