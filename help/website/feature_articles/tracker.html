<h2>OsmAnd Online GPS Tracker</h2>

<p>We are pleased to announce that we have a new application in OsmAnd family. This application helps to see your contacts on the map in OsmAnd. It has a social aspect; you need to have contacts, that's why it was challenging for us to choose the platform to build it on.</p>

<p>We have chosen Telegram as the most open social platform since it has an Open API, Open SDK and, moreover, it will eventually have an Open Server implementation (Blockchain).</p>

        <div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div>
<p>It is important that we have a great level of interoperability between the applications. You can easily exchange your location with your contacts without having 'Telegram mobile app' (OsmAnd Online GPS Tracker is an independent telegram client) and, the other way around, your contacts should not necessarily have OsmAnd Online GPS Tracker in order to see your location.</p>
<p>We designed OsmAnd Online GPS Tracker so you could still use your Telegram app and OsmAnd app naturally without flaws.</p>

<p>The application sends the Live Location messages to the selected chats for the time you specified, displays a list of your contacts and groups, and checks the chats for the presence of the messages with a location, which are then displayed on the map in OsmAnd.
The application does not send or view your text messages.</p>

<span>
Log in using your phone number registered in Telegram to enable the following:
<ul>
    <li>Manage the list of contacts and groups that send you their location</li>
    <li>View the location of contacts and groups in real time on a map in OsmAnd</li>
    <li>Set the time for sharing the location separately for each chat</li>
    <li>Set the location update frequency</li>
    <li>Watch the chronology of your and your contacts' movement</li>
</ul>

<h3>Settings:</h3>
<p>There are several settings for managing the frequency of sharing locations and controlling the display of the locations sent to you.</p>
<p><b>Send my location</b> — allows you to set the interval for sending your position from once per second (for increasing accuracy) to once in 5 minutes (for reducing power consumption).</p>
<p><b>Not moving</b> — allows you to set the time (from 1 minute to 1 hour) after which the location of your contact will be considered outdated. If the location becomes outdated, the position becomes gray.</p>
<p><b>Location history</b> — allows setting the time (from 5 minutes to 24 hours) after which the contact with the deleted location will be hidden from the list and the OsmAnd map.</p>
<p><b>Send location as</b> - allows you to make a selection of the category of sending a message about your location in Telegram (3 types of sending): text, map, text and map.</p>
<p><b>Buffer expiration time</b> - allows you to choose time to keep saving points in the buffer.</p>
<p><b>Background work</b> - allows you to change battery optimization settings to stabilize location sharing.</p>

<h3>OsmAnd Assistant:</h3>

<p>We have also prepared a Telegram bot called 'OsmAnd Assistant,' so you can integrate OsmAnd Telegram with 3rd party trackers or APIs. Hence, you can not only share your location but also the locations of your bicycle or a group of individuals taking part in racing which is available via API, and OsmAnd Telegram will make sure you have a nice presentation of locations on the map in OsmAnd itself.</p>
<p>Please share with us what you think about this new app on <a href="https://twitter.com/osmandapp">Twitter</a> and other social channels.</p>
<p>To view the GPS positions of contacts on the map, you need the latest version of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand">OsmAnd</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand.plus">OsmAnd+</a>.
