<p>If you are experiencing issues using OsmAnd, we kindly suggest that you contact the OsmAnd support team at <b>support@osmand.net</b>. However, some frequent issues can be fixed by reinstalling the app. Back up your files first, from your device's file manager, <i>OsmAnd - Settings - OsmAnd settings - Data storage folder to check the path to your 'osmand' folder</i>. Then you can copy the files to any storage you trust. Alternatively, export files using OsmAnd app by going to <i>'My places' - then select 'My tracks' or 'My favorites' (you can export both), and press "Share"</i>. Send your favorites to an e-mail, or use Nextcloud. etc. You'll be able to import files later.</p>
<p>Now you can uninstall the app. Go to your device's <i>Settings - Apps - OsmAnd, and choose 'Uninstall'</i>. After that, install it from where you got it. Previous purchases will be available, and you won't have to pay for them again.</p>
<div class="blocksubtitle">iOS</div>
<p>If you delete OsmAnd, all your favorites and trips will be deleted, so you have to back them up manually. To export your favorites, please go to <i>'My favorites' - 'Export favorite' and use the storage you trust</i>. Now you can delete and install the app, as usual. To reinstall the app, long tap on its icon and press the "+". Then go to iTunes and install it again. If it does not solve the issue, please contact us <b>support@osmand.net</b>.</p>
<p>If you use your iCloud or iTunes apps for that, please be aware that you can control the things being saved. Not only your OsmAnd data, but the data used by other apps may be backed up. To make the backup, please go to <i>Settings - iCloud - Storage - Manage storage</i>, tap the name of your device, then find Backup options and make sure OsmAnd backup is turned on. You can also remove the apps you do not need to backup here. The backup is done. Please read more <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203977">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you see error "-25/-26/-27" while installing the app, please try the steps below, or contact support. The issue you are experiencing is confirmed to be the fault of Xiaomi MIUI's integrated antivirus. To avoid it, you need to freeze the "Guard Provider" process before updating OsmAnd. Then, once updated, you can re-enable it. There are many ways and tools to freeze a process, and you will find one if you search for it. Some of our users have used 3C Toolbox or App Master, but we leave this to your preference.</p>
<p>To freeze a process, follow these steps: Go to 'App Manager' - in the 'Apps' tab - filter by 'System Apps' - select the "Guard Provider" - tap the "Manage" button (bottom right, four little squares) - "Freeze". To unfreeze, repeat the same procedure. Unfortunately "App Master" does not do freeze in the OsmAnd Free version. 3C Toolbox does the trick, but you will find the "Guard Provider" process as "com.securitycore.miui_t" under "Apps" with the filter on "System".</p>
