<div class="centeredimageblog">
<img src="/images/blog/routeinfo/1.png"/>
<img src="/images/blog/routeinfo/1a.jpg"/>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div>

<p>There are <i>Road types, Surface, Smoothness, Steepness, Surface firmness (Tracktype), Winter, and ice roads available</i>. The graphs are interactive and synchronized with one another and the route overview map.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: when you click on the graph, the cursor is displayed where you tap, and in the legend below the current chart element is highlighted in bold.

<p>On the overview map of the route, which is located at the very top of the screen, the scale will be changed so that the entire section of the path displayed on the graphs is currently displayed.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: If the graphic does not contain any data, it is not displayed.</p>


<p>Here is an example of a style that depends on the standard OsmAnd style and adds a street lighting scheme:</p>

<div class="subtitle" id="plan-route"><h2>Plan a route (Android)</h2></div>

<p>'Plan a route' is a convenient tool allowing you to measure distances between multiple points on the map - both connected by straight lines or by calculated routes.</p>
<p>This feature is also very convenient for your trip planning: add the points you'd like to visit to the map, calculate routes between them or just connect them with straight lines if you only need a general understanding of the trip, then export the results as a GPX track and follow it later.  Please learn how to export your points as a GPX file here:</p>

<div class="subtitle" id="Route_from_Favorites"><h2>Making a route from Favorites</h2></div>
<div class="blocksubtitle">Android</div>

<p>You can join your <a href="https://osmand.net/features/favourites#View_favorites_on_map_android">favorites into a route</a>. This is especially handy on vacations and trips to new places: add the points you'd like to visit to Favorites and then build a route covering them all. To do that, just go to <i>My places-> My favorites</i> and tap the flag icon in the bottom. Now you can choose the locations to visit. After that, tap the flag icon once again. You'll see them all as <a href="https://osmand.net/features/map-markers#markers_favorites_A">map markers</a> on the top of the screen. Tap the &#8942; button to add them to the route. You can also sort the markers from closest to you to the farthest or vice versa. To order markers or change the order, just tap the right upper button on the map markers screen. You can also <a href="https://osmand.net/features/navigation#How_to_add_remove_waypoints">add waypoints</a> after the route is calculated. Just tap on the map and choose Add as last intermediate waypoint. You'll be able to arrange the waypoints after that. Choose your starting point in the navigation menu. You can start the route from your current position, a Favorite on the map, the point on map you select or a particular address.</p>

<div class="blocksubtitle">iOS</div>

<p>To add your <a href="https://osmand.net/features/favourites#View_favorites_on_map_ios">favorites as waypoints</a>, you'll need to go to <i>My places-> Trips-> Create new trip</i>, and then tap the Favorites manually to add them as waypoints. Then press Save.</p>
<p>More information you can find <a href="https://osmand.net/features/favourites#Using_favorites_ios">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can start the route from your current position, a Favorite on the map, the point on map you select or a particular address.</p>


<div class="subtitle" id="Trip_planning_iOS"><h2>Trip planning for iOS</h2></div>

<p>OsmAnd for iOS has a trip planning option. It allows you to save your waypoints and view their location. To create a new trip, enter the My trips menu: <i>My Places-> Trips</i>, choose <i>Create new trip</i> and then add waypoints by making long taps. You can also add details to the waypoint, such as its name, color indicating this waypoint, its group (you can create a group of waypoints: work locations, favorite spots on town, etc.) and a description. Then hit Save. You'll be able to view your saved trip in <i>My Places-> Trips</i>.</p>

<p>Try the route management menu to sort the points. Tap the 'Waypoints' button on the blue toolbar, then drag the waypoint you'd like to move higher on the list using the '≡' button or swipe that waypoint's name to the left and tap the arrow icon. You can also activate or deactivate waypoints to customize your route in this menu. Add an endless number of waypoints.</p>

<p>Also, you can try navigation between two points. To do that, please select a starting point and a destination and begin your trip. Adjust your route by pressing the gear wheel button and selecting the options you prefer or going to 'Navigation settings' menu.</p>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div>

<p>You'll see the added waypoints in an information bar on the top of the screen. Now you can view waypoints or delete them by pressing the '^' button at the information bar and swiping to the left. Tap the point you need to get to in order to see the distance to it and view its location on the map. Please note that the points are connected by straight lines and are meant to help you create a general understanding of the directions for your trip. Unfortunately, this tool does not provide navigation along the streets yet. However, you can try simple navigation between two points using the directions provided below. To mark a waypoint as visited, swipe the name of the waypoint left and press the checkmark button ('✓').</p>
