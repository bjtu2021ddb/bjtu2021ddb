<p>Let&#39;s say you went on a vacation in your car and parked it to go for a walk around the city. How to make sure you find your vehicle when it&#39;s time to go back? The easiest way is to save its location with a plugin. It marks the exact location of your car and helps you find it without memorizing the street name or the number of turns to the block where you left it. Just enjoy your trip and do not let anything bother you. Do not worry about the limited parking time: you can easily set an alarm with any calendar app you're using to get a reminder when it&#39;s time to return.</p>

<p>Please note that the reminders are often set to appear 5 minutes before the event, so if you set the parking time limit to less than 5 minutes, you might not get a reminder.</p>
<p>You'll see the parking marker on the map, as well, so if you need to return to the parking spot, just tap on the destination bar on the top and the parking place will be displayed directly on the map.</p>
